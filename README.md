# DACTYLO TEST (WIP)

	-This is a little dactylo test made in C.
	-Actually this just show the number of "char" that you have written.
	-I will check later for some errors, the number of words and maybe more.
	-It uses a "list.txt" file that I made, so you can put your words in.
HOW TO USE IT

	-When install with a git clone or with a zip file, you just have to type "make" or "make all" and "make re" works too.

	-It makes a little executable names "dact".
	-To launch it you just have to type "./dact liste.txt (because you can make more list) [number of word]".

	-And then it displays the words.
